# Welcome to the MEG Analysis Introductory course

[TOC]

This course aims to get teach you some of the most basic steps in MEG analysis. Since the data is very similar and analysis diverges only at very few points what you will learn will also be applicable to EEG analysis. By this point I will assume that you have at least some basic knowledge (ADD A LINK??) about M/EEG, so that we don't need to invest too much time beyond some short reminders. While some coding experience with Matlab would make you more comfortable right from the start, we are not implementing any rocket science. So don't worry.



# What are we measuring with M/EEG?







# Why is this cool?





# Why Fieldtrip?

Why not? 

Fieldtrip is an extensive MATLAB toolbox containing a vast amount of functions for anaylsis of electrophysiological data (human as well as animal). The toolbox was and still is mainly developed at the [Donders Institute] (https://www.ru.nl/donders/) (especially Robert Oostenveld and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen)
